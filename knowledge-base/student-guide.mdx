## 4) See your feedback

- After the lesson, open the Lesson page to review:
  - Grammar: structures you used (and how to improve)
  - Vocabulary: words by CEFR level (A1–C2)
  - Mistakes: what happened and how to fix it next time
- You’ll see progress from lesson to lesson — not just a single score

## 5) Track vocabulary and grammar

- Vocabulary History: browse words you used, with CEFR levels and examples
- Grammar: see patterns you’re mastering and areas to practice

## 6) Set goals with your teacher

- Define simple goals (e.g., “Use more B2 vocabulary in meetings”)
- Follow your progress with clear, visual summaries

## 7) Message your teacher

- Use Messages to ask questions, share texts, or plan your next lesson

<Tip>
  Use a quiet place and a good microphone. Chrome works best for calls.

## Common questions

### Do I need to prepare?

Bring a topic or a text you care about. The AI adapts to any subject.

### Is my data private?

Yes. Your lessons are only used to help you improve and to inform your teacher’s feedback.
