## 4) See your feedback
- After the lesson, open the Lesson page to review:
	- Grammar: structures you used (and how to improve)
	- Vocabulary: words by CEFR level (A1–C2)
	- Mistakes: what happened and how to fix it next time
- You’ll see progress from lesson to lesson—not just a single score

## 5) Track vocabulary and grammar
- Vocabulary History: browse words you used, with CEFR levels and examples
- Grammar: see patterns you’re mastering and areas to practice

## 6) Set goals with your teacher
- Define simple goals (e.g., “Use more B2 vocabulary in meetings”)
- Follow your progress with clear, visual summaries

## 7) Message your teacher
- Use Messages to ask questions, share texts, or plan your next lesson

## Tips for best results
- Use a quiet place and a good microphone
- Chrome browser works best for calls
- Try to speak in complete sentences—the AI can help you more

## Common questions
- “Do I need to prepare?”
	- Bring a topic or a text you care about. The AI adapts to any subject.
- “Is my data private?”
	- Yes. Your lessons are only used to help you improve and to inform your teacher’s feedback.
