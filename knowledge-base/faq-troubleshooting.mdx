# FAQ & Troubleshooting

## Can I use JustTalk AI on my phone?
Yes, but a laptop with Chrome and a good microphone gives the best results.

## I can’t join my live lesson
- Make sure your browser can use the microphone/camera (allow permissions)
- Try a different network or close other video apps
- Reload the page; if it keeps failing, restart your browser

## I was invited but can’t see my teacher
- Open the invite email and click Accept Invite
- If you signed up with a different email, ask your teacher to re‑invite that email

## I don’t see grammar or vocabulary feedback
- Feedback appears after the lesson finishes
- Refresh the lesson page in a minute; some analysis takes a short while

## I booked a lesson but my credits didn’t update
- Check Billing to confirm your credit balance
- If it looks wrong, contact your teacher; they can help verify the booking

## My audio quality is bad
- Use wired headphones or a USB mic if possible
- Stay close to the mic and choose a quiet space

## Is my data private?
Yes. Your recordings and text are only used to provide feedback inside JustTalk AI.

## Where do I change my password or email?
Go to Account or Settings. If you’re locked out, use Forgot Password.
