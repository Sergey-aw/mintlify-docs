# Teacher Guide

Welcome! This guide shows how to set up your class, invite students, run lessons, and use AI insights to coach effectively.

## 1) Set up your account
- Sign up and complete Teacher Onboarding (profile, preferences)
- Visit your Dashboard and the Students roster

## 2) Invite your students
- Go to Students → Invite Student
- Enter their email; we create their student profile and link them to you
- If the email already belongs to a teacher account, we won’t convert it (you’ll see an error)

## 3) Schedule and run lessons
- Use Calendar/Lessons to see your schedule and availability
- Book lessons (one‑click) for upcoming times with each student
- When it’s time, start the call in Live Lesson Call; AI captures the session for feedback

## 4) Review AI feedback
- After each lesson, open the Lesson page:
  - Grammar structures: what appeared and where to focus
  - Vocabulary by CEFR: the levels your student used
  - Mistakes: patterns, examples, and suggestions
- Use these insights to assign homework or plan the next session

## 5) Track goals and progress
- In Student Goals, agree on achievable targets (e.g., “reduce tense errors in storytelling”)
- Check progress pages to see trends across time and lessons

## 6) Communicate with students
- Use Messages to share prompts, reading texts, or audio notes
- Keep all context in one place for you and your students

## 7) Billing and credits (if enabled)
- Sell lesson packages in Billing; students spend credits when booking
- You’ll see balances and purchases associated with each student

<Note>
  Use “Invite Student” (not manual creation) so roles and links are correct.

## Best practices
- Take 30 seconds post‑lesson to jot a note — future you will thank you
- Encourage full‑sentence speaking; it improves analysis quality

## How JustTalk AI helps you stand out
- Time saved: you teach; AI handles the measurement
- Targeted coaching: see exactly which structures and words need attention
- Motivation: students see progress in concrete terms, lesson by lesson
